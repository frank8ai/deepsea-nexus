# Decision Card

## Metadata
- Decision ID: DEC-YYYYMMDD-XX
- Date:
- Owner:
- Status: draft | in_progress | completed | stopped
- Scope: low | medium | high

## Hard Gates (must pass before execution)
- [ ] Goal is explicit and singular.
- [ ] Constraints are explicit (time, budget, dependencies).
- [ ] Success metrics are numeric thresholds.
- [ ] Stop condition is defined.
- [ ] At least 3 models are selected for comparison.
