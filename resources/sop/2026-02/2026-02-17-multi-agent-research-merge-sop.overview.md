# L1 Overview - 多代理并行研究与合并

## When to use
- >=2 plausible options
- high uncertainty
- medium+ risk
- high impact decision

## Inputs
- Input 1: research question/topic.
- Input 2: constraints (time, budget, stack, security posture).

## Outputs
- Output 1: Research pack in `resources/research-packs/YYYY-MM/<topic>.md` with evidence + option matrix.
- Output 2: Decision card in `resources/decisions/YYYY-MM/<topic>.md` with chosen option + next steps.
- Output 3 (optional): rule updates and anti-patterns (route to 复盘写回 SOP).

## Minimal procedure
1) Clarify problem statement and success criteria
2) Spawn 3 parallel roles (Researcher/Critic/Builder)
3) Collect outputs and normalize format
4) Synthesizer merges with conflict table
5) Produce option matrix and recommendation
6) Write decision card + next actions
7) Route writeback
8) Log iteration

## Quality gates
- Non-negotiables (legal/safety/security/data integrity) are explicitly checked.
- Objective is explicit and measurable.
- Outcome metric includes baseline and target delta.

## Invocation
`按SOP执行：多代理并行研究与合并 <输入>`
