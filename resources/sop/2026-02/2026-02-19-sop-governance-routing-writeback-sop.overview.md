# L1 Overview - SOP Governance Routing and Assetized Writeback

## When to run
- New SOP creation or upgrade request.
- HQ and Nexus SOP references drift.
- Execution completed but writeback assets are missing.

## Core decision
- Execution entry: `SOP/` (HQ).
- Canonical authority: `resources/sop/` (Nexus).
- Long outputs: files first, summary + path in chat/main.

## Mandatory outputs
- Routing decision with both HQ entry and Nexus canonical path.
- Asset writeback bundle:
  - memory card
  - counterexample or risk note
  - parameter delta
  - reusable snippet
- KPI/stop-condition decision record.
