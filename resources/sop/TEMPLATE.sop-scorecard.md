## Candidate Options
| Option | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A | | |
| B | | |
| C | | |

## Weighted Dimensions
| Dimension | Weight (0-1) | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Effectiveness | 0.35 | Outcome quality and goal fit |
| Cycle Time | 0.20 | Throughput and speed |
| Error Prevention | 0.20 | Risk and defect reduction |
| Implementation Cost | 0.15 | Build and maintenance cost |
| Operational Risk | 0.10 | Stability and failure impact |

## Scoring Table (1-5 for each dimension)
| Option | Effectiveness | Cycle Time | Error Prevention | Implementation Cost | Operational Risk | Weighted Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | | | | | | |
| B | | | | | | |
| C | | | | | | |

## Calculation Rule
- Weighted Score = sum(score * weight)
- Highest weighted score wins only if hard constraints pass.
- Release thresholds:
  - Winner weighted score >= 3.50.
  - Winner margin over second option >= 0.20, or explicit override reason.

## Best Practice Evidence
| Practice | Source | Evidence Type | Expected Benefit | Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## Best Method Decision
- Selected method:
- Why this method is best under current constraints:
- Rejected alternatives and reasons:

## Best Tool Decision
| Tool | Role | Measured Gain | Risk | Rollback Path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## Hard Constraint Check
